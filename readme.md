# Neovim Config

My configuration files for neovim.

Comments in Spanish.

Mostly for my own personal use, but go ahead and take parts of it -- or all of it -- if you want to.

In general, I do *not* recommend simply installing this blindly. Some stuff might not work if your setup is unlike mine.

This is a config for a heavily customized neovim setup. It includes:

- Syntax and indentation files for julia, taken from the [julia-vim plugin](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim)
- Custom filetype plugin files for julia, python, css, html, tex, markdown, vimscript, R, haskell, bib files
- A modified version of the mmarkdown markdown superset syntax file as found [here](https://github.com/Matthew-Tate-Scarbrough/mmarkdown)
- A custom completion script using the `<tab>` key, including a slightly changed version for haskell to conform to haskell indentation oddities
- A custom script for changing keyboard maps depending on the mode
- Four plugins found in `pack/plugins/start` (which I just included in the repo because they are small)
- Four custom color schemes (and a minor variation on one of them)
- Miscelaneous keybindings, settings and configuration
